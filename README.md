## Description

Easy-Locust is an extension tool for Locust. With this tool, you don't need to write locust scripts. What you need to do is just to edit Excel. Easy-Locust will generate locustfile automatically and run it.

If you need master-slave mode, you just need to fill Excel Sheet 'Slave', and use --master. The only precondition is to install the same version locustio in each Slave.
Easy-Locust is not necessary for slaves. 

Use `easy-locust --demo` to generate an Excel demo, fill it and start your test.
